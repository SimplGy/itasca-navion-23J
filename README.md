# Itasca Navion 23J "The Ivory Tower"

This isn't a code repository.

It's for tracking work on the RV. I'm a programmer so this tool is low-friction for me, and it turns out to be pretty well suited to this task.

Some of the issues in this are general, but most would apply to anybody who owns an Itasca Navion or Winnebago View RV.

If you're reading this in the future I hope it's helpful to you with your RV. If you're reading this and there is an open issue you know something about, please chime in, I'd love that.

### Things to learn:

* Does the engine battery charge the house? How about when that main relay is off?
* What happens when propane runs low/out, is there an alarm? (important because the fridge will defrost)
* Does using the heater appreciably use electricity (eg: if I use it all the time off grid, is it only propane I need to worry about, or electric too?)
* Is 26g enough fresh water, or do I need to upgrade?
