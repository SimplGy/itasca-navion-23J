# Itasca Navion 23J "The Ivory Tower"

This isn't a code repository.

It's for tracking work on the RV. I'm a programmer so this tool is low-friction for me, and it turns out to be pretty well suited to this task.

Some of the issues in this are general, but most would apply to anybody who owns an Itasca Navion or Winnebago View RV.

If you're reading this in the future I hope it's helpful to you with your RV. If you're reading this and there is an open issue you know something about, please chime in, I'd love that.

### Things to learn:

* Does the engine battery charge the house? How about when that main relay is off?
* What happens when propane runs low/out, is there an alarm? (important because the fridge will defrost)
* Does using the heater appreciably use electricity (eg: if I use it all the time off grid, is it only propane I need to worry about, or electric too?)
* Is 26g enough fresh water, or do I need to upgrade? -- not nearly enough. A shower uses 3 gallons if you're super conservative, and you'll probably use another 2 washing hands, dishes, etc. So you can only boondock 5 or 6 days on 26g.

### Interesting facts about the 2006 Sprinter Chassis

* My Engine: 2.7L I5 OM 612/ OM 647 156 hp CDI
* 

Also called:

* Dodge Sprinter
* Freightliner Sprinter
* Mercedes-Benz Transporter T1N

T1N means "Transporter 1 Neu" It's the first generation van 2002 to 2006 in the US, and only came with a 2.7 liter inline 5 cyl diesel.

> From 2001 until 2006, cargo van versions of the Sprinter were manufactured in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, partially disassembled and shipped to a facility in Gaffney, South Carolina where they were reassembled. The cargo versions, classified as light trucks, are subject to the 25% chicken tax if imported as a complete unit. The cargo version of this model is re-assembled at a plant in Ladson, South Carolina which was previously used as an American LaFrance factory.
