# itasca-navion-23J

This isn't a code repository.

I've gotten so used to github issues I'm going to use them to plan work on the RV.

### Things to learn:

* Does the engine battery charge the house? How about when that main relay is off?
* What happens when propane runs low/out, is there an alarm? (important because the fridge will defrost)
* Does using the heater appreciably use electricity (eg: if I use it all the time off grid, is it only propane I need to worry about, or electric too?)
* Is 26g enough fresh water, or do I need to upgrade?
